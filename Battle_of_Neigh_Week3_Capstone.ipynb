    "The challenge to resolve is being able to find a rental apartment unit in Manhattan that offers similar characteristics and benefits to my current situation. Therefore, in order to set a basis for comparison, I want to find a renta unit subject to the following conditions: \n",
    "- Apartment with min 2 bedrooms with monthly rent not to exceed US$700/month\n",
    "- Unit located within walking distance (<=1.0 mile, 1.6 km) from a subway metro station in Manhattan\n",
    "- Area with ammenities and venues similar to the ones described for current location \n",

    "### 1.3 Interested Audience\n",
    "I believe this is a relevant project for a person or entity considering moving to a major city in Europe, US or Asia, since the approach and methodologies used here are applicable in all cases. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help resolve the key questions arisen. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills."
